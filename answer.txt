{"question": "What are rule-based chatbots?", "answer": "Rule-based chatbots follow predefined rules or scripts to generate responses."}
{"question": "What are AI-based chatbots?", "answer": "AI-based chatbots use machine learning and NLP to generate more flexible and context-aware responses."}
{"question": "What is NLP?", "answer": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables machines to understand and interact with human language."}
{"question": "How do chatbots understand user intent?", "answer": "They use intent classification through NLP models or keyword-based matching."}
{"question": "What's an example of an intent in chatbot design?", "answer": "An example could be 'book_flight' or 'check_weather'."}
{"question": "How do chatbots manage conversation context?", "answer": "By tracking past exchanges and user data to maintain coherent dialogue."}
{"question": "What is slot filling?", "answer": "Slot filling is gathering specific information pieces needed to fulfill a user's request."}
{"question": "What is fallback intent?", "answer": "It's the default response when a chatbot doesn't understand a user's input."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of using pre-trained language models in chatbots?", "answer": "They improve understanding, provide richer responses, and reduce training data requirements."}
{"question": "What is natural language processing?", "answer": "Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language."}
{"question": "What is reinforcement learning?", "answer": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards."}
